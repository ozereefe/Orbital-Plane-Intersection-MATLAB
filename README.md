# Orbital Plane Intersection MATLAB

This repository contains a MATLAB project focused on calculating orbital plane intersections and other orbital mechanics parameters. The code takes input from topocentric-horizon coordinates and computes the intersection of the orbital plane with the ground station.

## Features
- **Orbital Plane Intersection Calculation**: Calculates the intersection of orbital planes with the ground station.
- **Coordinate Transformations**: Computes ECEF, ECIF, and perifocal transformations.
- **Orbital Parameter Calculation**: Computes orbital elements such as inclination (i), RAAN, argument of perigee, true anomaly, semi-major axis (a), and eccentricity (e).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Run the `orbital_intersection.m` script in MATLAB.
3. Ensure you have the required input data, such as topocentric-horizon coordinates.

## Installation

To use this code, you must have MATLAB installed. The project does not require any external libraries but is intended for use in the context of orbital mechanics studies.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests for any improvements or bug fixes!
